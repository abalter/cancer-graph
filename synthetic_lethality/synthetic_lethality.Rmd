# Working Definition

_A synthetic lethal interaction between two paired genes indicates that perturbation of either gene alone is viable, but that perturbation of both genes simultaneously causes the loss of viability_

## Inhibition of DNA Repair as a Therapeutic Target

### Concept of Synthetic Lethality

>The term “synthetic lethality” was originally coined by geneticists in the 1940s to describe the process where mutations in two different genes together resulted in cell death but independently did not affect viability [280]. The concept was applied to cancer somewhat later to explain the selective killing of cancer cells with particular molecular defects, by some agents [281]. It is becoming apparent that dysregulation of the DNA damage response (DDR), that contributes to the genomic instability that is an enabling characteristic of cancer, can be exploited by the synthetic lethality approach. Loss of one component of the DDR may be compensated by another backup component in the same (or different) pathway, on which the cancer cell becomes dependent. This has been termed “non-oncogene addiction”. Inactivating this compensatory pathway is therefore a means of selectively targeting the tumor (Fig. 8.12). Exploitation of dysregulation of the DDR by the synthetic lethality approach is perhaps the most exciting prospect for the future of cancer treatment [282].

### FIGURE 8.12. 
>Synthetic lethality: normal cells contain primary and backup DDR proteins (A and B) to cope with endogenous and induced DNA damage. The genomic instability that enables cancer to develop can be due to loss of one of these pathways (A) leading to hyperdependence on the other (B), which may be amplified. Using an inhibitor of B leads to cell death in the cancer cell but not the normal cell, because this still has protein A to deal with endogenous or induced DNA damage.

## A Data Integration Workflow to Identify Drug Combinations Targeting Synthetic Lethal Interactions
Protocol https://www.jove.com/t/60328/a-data-integration-workflow-to-identify-drug-combinations-targeting
Marhold, M., Heinzel, A., Merchant, A., Perco, P., Krainer, M. A Data Integration Workflow to Identify Drug Combinations Targeting Synthetic Lethal Interactions. <em>J. Vis. Exp.</em> (171), e60328, doi:10.3791/60328 (2021).

>A synthetic lethal interaction between two genes is given when knock-out of either one of the two genes does not affect cell viability but knock-out of both synthetic lethal interactors leads to loss of cell viability or cell death. The best studied synthetic lethal interaction is between BRCA1/2 and PARP1, with PARP1 inhibitors being used in clinical practice to treat patients with BRCA1/2 mutated tumors. Large genetic screens in model organisms but also in haploid human cell lines have led to the identification of numerous additional synthetic lethal interaction pairs, all being potential targets of interest in the development of novel tumor therapies. One approach is to therapeutically target genes with a synthetic lethal interactor that is mutated or significantly downregulated in the tumor of interest. A second approach is to formulate drug combinations addressing synthetic lethal interactions. In this article, we outline a data integration workflow to evaluate and identify drug combinations targeting synthetic lethal interactions. We make use of available datasets on synthetic lethal interaction pairs, homology mapping resources, drug-target links from dedicated databases, as well as information on drugs being investigated in clinical trials in the disease area of interest. We further highlight key findings of two recent studies of our group on drug combination assessment in the context of ovarian and breast cancer._

They say things like "identified" or even "validated" previously unreported SL interactions. But I don't think they mean that they went and tested them in the lab.

https://academic.oup.com/database/article/doi/10.1093/database/baac030/6585691

An extensive knowledge graph compiled from other sources. Some of these contain known SL pairs. Others are used for prediction. SynLethDB 2.0 ingested hetionet using scripts provided by hetionet. Does prediction using some simple statistical models.

Published in May 2022, provides a portal presumably to facilitate that group and other groups to use this resource to generate results to be published or used for R&D.

Perhaps worthwhile looking at the _Case Studies_ in the [results section](https://academic.oup.com/database/article/doi/10.1093/database/baac030/6585691#354329910).

Given a known cancer drug that treats one cell type, can we predict other cell types sensitive to that drug?
Given a cell type treated by a list of drugs, are there other known drugs that could treat that cell type?
